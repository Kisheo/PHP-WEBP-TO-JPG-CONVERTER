# PHP-WEBP-TO-JPG-CONVERTER
## Steps to Use This Script:

   - Set Up XAMPP:
    Ensure you have XAMPP installed and running on your machine. Place this PHP script in the htdocs directory of your XAMPP installation.

    - Create Directories:
    Create two directories: one for the source WebP images and another for the converted JPG images. Update the $webpDirectory and $jpgDirectory variables in the script with the appropriate paths.

    - Run the Script:
    Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost/your_script.php (replace your_script.php with the actual filename of your PHP script).

## Notes:

    Ensure that the gd extension is enabled in your PHP configuration (which is usually the case by default in XAMPP).
    Adjust the paths in the script according to your directory structure.
    This script will convert all .webp files in the specified directory to .jpg files and save them in the specified output directory.
